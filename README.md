JonBot-NG
=========

The third and final iteration of my Zezenia Automation tool.

JonBot, the first iteration was nothing more than key and mouse stroke automation. Watching the screen, and reacting to
changes.

JonBot2, took the original further, digging into the Zezenia clients running memory to read information directly
from the client instead of watching for pixels changing colors on the screen. A more advanced, but cleaner version
of the original. This version also included a functional warrior cave bot with a scripter. It would follow the
scripted path killing monsters and looting them along the way. This version suffered from my lack of deep knowledge
in how to access and understand an applications memory.

JonBot-NG seeks to rectify the inadequacies of JonBot2, while at the same time providing a more advanced, more 
complete, and cleaner tool for the end user.
